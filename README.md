# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Overview
  -This week I got to work with Beks. Together we will comb through a CSV file given to her containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup in years past. First we must process the data for a Neutral Network Model then compile, train, and elevate the model. Lastly we will need to optimize the model and we are coomplete.
  
### Results 
  - Next overviewing our results we processed the data to find variables that will be targets for our models, features for our model, and some that are neither features or targets. 
  - The main variable I targeted for my model is IS_SUCCESSFUL. 
  - Lastly our variables that were neither features or targets for the dataset is EIN, NAME mainly due to not having an impact on the eventual outcome of our tests. 
 
### Summary
  - At the end of our tests and optimizations Beks and I ended up with a loss of 0.55 and an accuracy of 0.72. I think we did an excellent job at reaching our end goal. We were able to optimize our data set by adding more data to the data set and lastly by removing more features we simply did not need.
